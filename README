= 1. Short project description ===============================

This program was designed for generating 3D trees based on
L-System language. More information about L-System can be
found for example on wikipedia. Authors decided to create own
very simple L-System scripting language for 3D visualization.
Simple parser was designed and option for saving and loading
script files. Program is able to display defined L-System
object in single window using OpenGL, which renders it in full
3D.

Sample L-System script file can be found in test directory.

Important note: IT WAS ACADEMIC PROJECT AND IT'S CODE QUALITY
AND APPLAIED DESIGN IS FAR FROM ACCEPTABLE LEVEL.

= 2. Compilation =============================================

Libraries required for a project are:
- Qt4
- Boost
- glm

All libraries execept Qt are using headers only. Be sure that
your settings in .pro file are set correctly:

INCLUDEPATH +=  <your path to boost> /
                <your path to glm>

Standard compilation: qmake && make
